Mandurah Swimming Club coaches together with the committee review the upcoming meets for the season and decide which meets to target as a club.

As a competitive swimming club, we encourage all swimmers to work towards competing at swim meets. Coaches will be in attendance at target meets to support our swimmers. Swimmer entries into meets must be discussed with the coach prior to registering.

Swimmers intending to nominate for Country Pennants have until (and including) Country Championships to obtain their fastest time for the season which will determine the squad.
