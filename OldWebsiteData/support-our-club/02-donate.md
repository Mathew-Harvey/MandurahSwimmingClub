## Containers for Change

Containers for Change is WA's container deposit scheme that aims to increase recycling of common beverage containers, reducing litter and landfill waste. For every eligible container returned, a 10-cent refund will be given.

Help support Mandurah Swimming Club by donating your containers! You can help us in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Donate your refund
Use your refund to support a worthy cause. Mandurah Swimming Club is registered as an official charity with Containers for Change, and you can support our club by donating your refund to us.

**Simply quote scheme ID C10322190 at your local refund point to donate your containers.**

### Option 2: Drop off your containers
We're collecting! Simply pop in to Mandurah Swimming Club's office with your eligible containers and we'll take care of the rest!
