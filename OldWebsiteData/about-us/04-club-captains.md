## Mandurah Swimming Club - Our Captains

Our Club Captains are appointed from nominations received from our club members. Two Club Captains are appointed for each Swimming season, 1 Male and 1 Female Captain is preferred however it depends on the nominations received.

The primary function of Club Captain is to facilitate communication between the swimmers and the Committee/Coaches, and to represent the swimmers in this regard. Club Captains need to be approachable and available to swimmers, so that their concerns can be raised.

### Selection Criteria

- Have an outgoing personality and excellent leadership skills
- Be willing to help out at carnivals, club nights and presentations
- Be ready to mentor and encourage junior swimmers
- Be encouraging and assist with creating an all-round club spirit

While considering nominees, the Committee will take into account the general attitude of the swimmer towards both training and racing. The committee will also consider how enthusiastic and supportive the swimmer is with their teammates, especially younger members.
